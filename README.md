# **Jocelyn Vazquez — Google Cybersecurity Portfolio**

## **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**
This portfolio highlights my work from the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. The program includes eight courses developed by Google, each with practice-based assessments designed to prepare learners for entry-level roles in cybersecurity.

Through this certificate, I developed foundational technical skills in:
- **Python** (beginner level)
- **Linux**
- **SQL**
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**

I gained experience identifying cybersecurity risks, threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies.
